On this page you can also define the default behaviour when publishing new posts.
These settings can easily be adjusted for each individual post by using the meta box that has been added to the post types that you have selected.

= How does this plugin do it? =
So you want to know what happens in the background, to get your post to diaspora*?
Well, this might be a little technical, but it's simple enough to understand the concept.

Basically, the server your WordPress installation is set up on makes a connection to your diaspora* pod, logs you in using the provided username and password, adds a new post (which is your WordPress post) and responds to say if everything was successful.

Quite straightforward, right?
